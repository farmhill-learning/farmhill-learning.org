Our own air potato! 

Dioscorea bulbifera, also known as bitter yam, air yam, cheeky yam, potato yam etc. is a species of true yam. It's called air potato because the bulbs look like potatos and grow on the vine instead of in the ground. 

It's edible and grows wild like a weed! We planted a bulb about six months back and forgot about it. It's grown like this today. Can't wait to taste it!
