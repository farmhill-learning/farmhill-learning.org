Many of us would agree that the way we educate our children needs a serious overhaul. There needs to be many alternatives to the monocultural way we are currently educating them. There are a few alternative schools that have been running successfully but we need many more. Farm Hill intends to provide one such alternative.

The other thread running through Farm Hill is the need for us to work with people who are different from the most of us. When we say ‘every child is different’, many of us do not seem to be extending the definition of ‘different’ to include children whose neurologies are different. Farm Hill intends to address this by including children on the autism spectrum in our student population.

Over a period of time, we have found that the way one educates an autistic child is no different from the way one educates a neurotypical child; it is just that the current school system is suitable for neither. We intend to work with both neurotypical and autistic children in a setting that takes care of the unique needs of each child.

## Farm Hill Story 

Farm Hill Learning was born from a deep sense of necessity - a need for a space where children, especially those who are neurodivergent, could learn, grow, and thrive without being constrained by the rigid structures and expectations of mainstream education. The journey began with a family’s experience of raising a child on the autism spectrum. It became clear that the existing schools, no matter how well-intentioned, were not equipped to truly understand or nurture the unique ways in which different children learn and interact with the world.

As parents, the first step was to create a home environment where learning could happen naturally, where the child could be surrounded by love, patience, and opportunities for discovery. This experience led to the realization that every child, regardless of neurology, deserves an education that honors their individuality and supports their development in a holistic way. The conventional school system, with its standardized curricula and emphasis on conformity, often fails to meet these needs, not just for neurodivergent children but for many others as well.

The desire to extend this kind of support to more families gave rise to [Sambhavam](https://sambhavam-autism.com/), an early intervention center in Bangalore that provides therapy and parent training for children with autism. Through this work, it became evident that while therapy and individualized support are essential, children also need a community - a place where they can be themselves, where their differences are celebrated, and where learning is woven into the fabric of daily life.

Farm Hill Learning was conceived as a continuation of this vision. The search for the right place led to a small farm near Hosur, chosen for its accessibility and its natural beauty. The farm, with its hill and surrounding jungle, became the ideal setting for a learning community that values closeness to nature and the rhythms of rural life. The name “Farm Hill” reflects this combination—the farm as a place of growth and sustenance, and the hill as a symbol of aspiration and possibility.

The philosophy at Farm Hill is rooted in the belief that education should not be a one-size-fits-all enterprise. It should be a collaborative process, where children and adults learn together, where the boundaries between teacher and learner are fluid, and where the focus is on cultivating curiosity, empathy, and resilience. The community is intentionally neurodiverse, welcoming children and adults of all backgrounds and abilities. This diversity is not just tolerated but embraced as a source of strength and richness.

At Farm Hill, the emphasis is on creating a space where children can develop a sense of belonging and autonomy. The learning environment is designed to be [flexible](https://farmhill-learning.org/learning-at-farmhill/flexible-learning-environment-2023/) and responsive, allowing for self-directed exploration as well as guided support. The farm, kitchen, and community serve as classrooms, offering opportunities for hands-on learning, creative expression, and social interaction.

The journey has not been without challenges. Starting a new community requires not only vision but also resilience, resourcefulness, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. The process has been organic, shaped by the needs and aspirations of the families involved. There have been moments of doubt and uncertainty, but also many moments of joy and connection that affirm the value of this endeavor.

oday, Farm Hill Learning stands as a testament to the power of community and the possibilities that arise when we come together with openness, honesty, and a shared commitment to nurturing the potential of every child. It is a place where learning is not confined to textbooks or classrooms but is woven into the everyday experiences of living, working, and growing together.

This is the story of Farm Hill so far - a story of hope, resilience, and the belief that education can be a transformative force in the lives of children and families.
