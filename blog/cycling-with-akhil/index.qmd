I am a 45‑year‑old, overweight woman in perimenopause, working with autistic young people at Farmhill. Today I was meant to take Akhil—an energetic 18‑year‑old who cycles well but needs occasional safety reminders—for a ride. Usually, I follow him on a moped, but today my bike wasn’t available.

When I suggested a walk instead, Akhil insisted on cycling. Not wanting to disappoint him, I explained that I couldn’t ride as fast and asked if he could slow down and wait when I fell behind. He agreed, repeating with a smile that I was old and all the other things.

We set off on our usual route. I managed the first two kilometers, but the hills soon challenged me. Each time I asked, Akhil waited, checking where I was. Remembering my earlier promise of an 8‑kilometer ride, he didn’t stop at our usual turnaround point. Trusting his patience, I pushed on.

For an hour, over hilly terrain, he kept to safety measures and quietly encouraged me—waiting, smiling when I thanked him. His kindness overwhelmed me. If someone had told me I’d complete this route, I wouldn’t have believed it. It was Akhil’s patience and calm encouragement that made it possible.

Beyond thanking him, I can only wish him all the good things he dreams for himself.
