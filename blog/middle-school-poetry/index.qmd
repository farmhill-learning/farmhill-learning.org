A poem our 11 year olds wrote in their English class, on the lines of "That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!"

Lift the cats, tease the dogs

Make some noise, bring a mouse

Leave the dust on the floor

That's what Chitra Aunty hates!

Leave your work lying around

Chat aloud, whine along

Kill the time, laze about

Gossip a lot and be a lout

Refuse food, just say no

Drop some rice in the water trough

Open the taps while washing plates

That's what Chitra Aunty hates!

Don't you listen, talk a lot

Don't focus you run around

Be mindless, give no thought

That's what Chitra Aunty hates!
