Kishkindha, our primary school group, went around Farm Hill looking for different kinds of seeds and how they go from place to place. 

We wrote a summary:

Plants have seeds.

Plants send seeds out. 

Some Plants have Pods that Pop!!

Some seeds drop,

Some seeds fly!

Some seeds stick,

Some seeds poke!

Some seeds float,

Some are Pooped out!!

And here are a few pictures!

All the seeds we collected!
