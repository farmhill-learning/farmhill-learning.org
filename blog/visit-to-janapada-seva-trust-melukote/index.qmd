Something that Sumanas Koulagi said will remain with us a long time, and I am ofcourse paraphrasing.

"Skills learnt as a part of curriculum, primarily to add to the experience of the children, will remain skills unused. If we really want to teach these as livelihood options, then the teachers should also be making their living out of the same skills"

In line with their thinking, they are planning to start a learning community/training center around the khadi weaving unit they have. Wishing them all the best and looking forward to it.

This was our introduction to livelihood education and we look forward to many more learning experiences.

Thanks again, Archana Khyadi , Santosh KoulagiÂ Sowmya, and suresha. And special mention of JaaNa from srikar. ðŸ™‚
