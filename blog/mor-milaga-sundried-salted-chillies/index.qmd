Here is the recipe.

1. Get healthy looking green mirchi.

2. Make a slit in each mirchi, using a pin. About a quarter of the length is enough. If you slit more, the chilli opens up fully later. We don't want that.

3. Take thick buttermilk and add enough salt. It should be salty.

4. Soak the mirchi in the buttermilk. Leave it for a day.

5. Next day, take out the mirchi and sun dry them. End of the day, put the mirchi back in the buttermilk and soak overnight. Repeat for 3 or 4 days till the mirchi soaks up the buttermilk and salt, and turns white. You can add more salt to the buttermilk if you feel the mirch is not salty enough.

6. After 3 to 4 days of above, discard the butter milk and just sundry the chillies till they are crispy dry.

7. Store in airtight container. Fry a few when needed, to compliment curd rice, kanji etc.
