Every year, we choose about three festive occasions to celebrate at Farm Hill. This year, Gandhi Jayanti was one of them. 

We felt it would be a nice opportunity for all of us to learn about Gandhi, his life and ideas. In the primary school, we read about Gandhi and his life, in a story format. We used the following books. Primary school decided to make skits based on Gandhi's life and presented on the day of celebration!

In the middle and high school, we watched the movie Gandhi, read some chapters of Gandhi Before India by Ramachandra Guha, and watched a few other videos. On Gandhi Jayanthi, this group presented a talk about a few select topics. 

Teachers spent some time reading and learning about Gandhi's ideas of education. We had a brief presentation on the idea of freedom. 

We all learnt a few songs related to the Indian freedom struggle and a few favorites of Gandhi. Here is a picture of the singing.

All of us also learnt to spin, and now spinning is going to be a part of school routines. 

Overall, it was a fun learning experience!
