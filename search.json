    "text": "At farm hill, we are in a rain shadow region where the average rain fall is closer to 800mm. There are no major surface water sources like rivers nearby; and the one there is, comes from Bangalore, full of waste water.\nNaturally, most of the agriculture here depends on ground water. Vegetables and green leaves are grown, but it is not uncommon to see water guzzling crops like rice too. Suffice it to say that the average depth of a borewell in this region has gone up by about 200 feet in the last three years.\nIn such scenario, our long term water management strategy needed to include surface water harvesting and some way of tapping the shallow aquifer, in addition to a borewell.\nConsidering the roof size and the rainfall, we could potentially harvest 250,000 liters of water annually, which is about a third of our current water requirement. Taking various factors into consideration, we invested in building an underground water harvesting tank of about 85,000 liters.\nThe last ten days of cyclonic weather meant the tank is nearly full. Right now, we estimate about 75,000 liters in the tank. That’s a happy thing.\nOn the other hand, these rains have been unseasonal, and heavy, causing a lot of damage to crops and devastation. Also, even here in the rain shadow region, about 30% of the entire annual rainfall happened in a single week, after a prolonged near dry spell during the monsoon, and that’s not great.\nIt’s a mixed feeling, I guess."

    "text": "At farm hill we use a “pot in pot” fridge to keep vegetables cool. You keep a pot within a bigger pot, fill the space between with sand and keep the sand wet (see picture). This makes the inner pot considerably cooler.  We have been able to keep vegetables fresh for up to three days in this “fridge”.\n\nToday, I wanted to clean the inner pot and took it out. Lo, there were three toads lodged in the sand!! Using a flat, long piece of wood, I managed to get them out and pushed them a little away, thinking they will go away.\nIn a little while, there is a rustle in the leaves near by. The toads were trying to come back to the pot!\nI took a stick to push the bigger of them away but he was not giving up. He jumped around, tried to get around me and then jumped straight at me, stick and all not withstanding!! The more I tried to push him away, the more insistent he was to get back. I would push him a whole 6 feet and he would come right back. He puffed up a little too, as if he was getting angry and trying to scare me. Personally, I was very very surprised at my complete inability to intimidate him. What kind of an animal jumps right at a human with a stick!!!\nThat’s when I realised he is desperate to get to the cool place, given it is very hot today here.\nFinally, I put some water around a rock nearby (see picture) and pushed him towards it. Once he felt the wetness, he has settled down a little bit.\n\nI know this was only round 1. Most likely, he will be back in the fridge by the evening!!"

    "text": "This week we learnt to make sun-dried onion masala balls.\nAll last year, our cook used to bring these dry onion balls which she would crush and put in while seasoning dal and vegetable gravies, unlocking amazing flavors. This time we decided to make them here.\nThis preparation seems to be local and we were completely unaware of how this works. Here is how it is done, with pictures in reverse order.\n1. Small sambar onions and garlic are peeled. They are ground together, turmeric and salt is added and left overnight.\n\n2. Curry leaves and whole spices used in South Indian seasoning are added. The mix is made into large balls and sun dried for 3 days.  \n\n3. After 3 days, the balls are squeezed by hand to remove excess moisture. Dried for 2 more days.\n\n4. Once they are without moisture, the balls are crumbled.\n\n5. Castor oil is heated and added to the crumble.\n6. This is now made into smaller egg sized balls and dried till they are completely dry. This may take a couple of weeks.\n\n7. These keep for a year, apparently. Just crush a small amount and add to seasoning when making dal.\n\nSince these balls are made using onions, garlic, castor oil etc non-satvik food, they attract bad spirits called peyi/pisasi in Tamil. Please note the red chillies, charcoal, grass kept in the middle to ward off evil spirits. 😊😊"

Today, there is less water, and the water does not have that much soil runoff.\nWhile one may not be able to say much about the quantity of water with any level of certainty based just on this, one hypothesis is that due to the growth of grass and plants in the intervening period across the property, there may be more local absorption of rain, less soil runoff and therefore less muddy water in the trenches.\nThis is kind of born out by the fact that we have water standing pretty much everywhere and a very small spring or two appearing at the base of the hill.\nThat’s a good thing, isn’t it? 🙂\nDo notice the Veppala tree on the left bank of the pond, and how it’s grown all by itself!"

Leave it for a day.\nNext day, take out the mirchi and sun dry them. End of the day, put the mirchi back in the buttermilk and soak overnight. Repeat for 3 or 4 days till the mirchi soaks up the buttermilk and salt, and turns white. You can add more salt to the buttermilk if you feel the mirch is not salty enough.\n\n\n\nAfter 3 to 4 days of above, discard the butter milk and just sundry the chillies till they are crispy dry.\n\n\n\nStore in airtight container.

Primary school decided to make skits based on Gandhi’s life and presented on the day of celebration!\n\nIn the middle and high school, we watched the movie Gandhi, read some chapters of Gandhi Before India by Ramachandra Guha, and watched a few other videos. On Gandhi Jayanthi, this group presented a talk about a few select topics.\nTeachers spent some time reading and learning about Gandhi’s ideas of education. We had a brief presentation on the idea of freedom.\nWe all learnt a few songs related to the Indian freedom struggle and a few favorites of Gandhi. Here is a picture of the singing.\n\nAll of us also learnt to spin, and now spinning is going to be a part of school routines.\nOverall, it was a fun learning experience!"

Went up a small hill and down the other side. Then another hill.\nFrom the top, we could see three familiar paths, one each side. We collected a few Pongamia pods to plant in the nursery. Then we took a path down the hill, to join one of the paths that would take us back to farm hill.\nOnce we hit the familiar path, we took right instead of left. A little along the path, a left instead of the usual right, on to a cart track. As if we were searching for something.\nWe could see the path stretching ahead of us to the next hill and we knew it would wind round to farm hill. That’s when we found what we weren’t looking for.\nA tree of White Gulmohar, Delonix Elata. We had seen a few of these trees around. The last time we saw another tree along another path, it had only flowers. And the flowers are beautiful.\nThis tree looked, big, dense, and inviting. We rushed to it as if it was calling us.\n\nThe flowers were beautiful, the sky was blue, and it had fruits. And the dry fruits on the ground, many of them had seeds! We walked around picking up the fruits and collecting seeds, only the fat ones.\nThe flower\n\nSeeds\n\nSeed Pods\n\nThe other side of the tree, we saw, was a shrine, that is when we noticed the sacred fig intertwined with this tree. The stems were nearly the same color, difficult to tell apart.\nThe shrine\n\nIt was magical, I am telling you, finding the beautiful, sacred tree, while we weren’t looking for it. And now we have seeds, wild ones, to put in the nursery!\nOh, by the way, the tree is also called Creamy Peacock Flower Tree!"

    "text": "At Farm Hill, we are at the bottom slope of a group of hills. At the lowest point, just next to the place, we have a water channel.\nWe have a few mango trees at Farm Hill. When I asked the previous owners where they got water from to plant the trees, they said they used to dig a shallow well next to the water channel and get water. When I asked if it’s still possible to do so, they said no, since there haven’t been good rains of late. This was a year back when we were just buying the place and I had forgotten about it.\nThe summer of 2019 was bad. It’s been about 10 years since the last major rains and all borewells went dry in May. In a 2 week period in May, about 15 bore wells around us were either deepened or freshly dug. The average depth of water level went down to more than 750 feet from about 450 feet. Our 500 feet borewell went fully dry. The rains this season have been good but it hasn’t recovered yet.\nMeanwhile, since getting the place, we looked at the slopes, dug about 5 levels of trenches, a few water holding ponds and more or less stopped rain water from flowing out of the space.\n\nA couple of days back, a member of our construction team noticed a little bit of water in a small hole in the water channel. When we checked, it turns out that was the place they used to get water in a shallow well earlier. Ganesan L went ahead and got a small shallow well, about 3 feet deep, dug.\n\nRight now we have water in it. We will watch it for a few days and see if we can deepen it further. This feels awesome being able to tap the shallow aquifer.\nAnd it made a great science lesson too!"

One day, he was all charred, someone had lit a fire to burn weeds and he was caught in the middle.\nAfter about a couple of years, happy to see today that he is back in bloom.\nAnd this season, not many Palash are blooming. Last year by this time, every tree around broke out in bloom. Don’t know what that means in terms of climate and impact, but our belief that trees are much more than what we think of them just gets strengthened a little more when we see such demonstrations of what one could call “willfulness”. 🙂🙂\nThese pictures are from today.\n\nA long shot but you can still see the flowers."

    "text": "Many of us would agree that the way we educate our children needs a serious overhaul. There needs to be many alternatives to the monocultural way we are currently educating them. There are a few alternative schools that have been running successfully but we need many more. Farm Hill intends to provide one such alternative.\nThe other thread running through Farm Hill is the need for us to work with people who are different from the most of us. When we say ‘every child is different’, many of us do not seem to be extending the definition of ‘different’ to include children whose neurologies are different. Farm Hill intends to address this by including children on the autism spectrum in our student population.\nOver a period of time, we have found that the way one educates an autistic child is no different from the way one educates a neurotypical child; it is just that the current school system is suitable for neither. We intend to work with both neurotypical and autistic children in a setting that takes care of the unique needs of each child."

In their journey with Autism, they started and continue to run Sambhavam, an ABA based therapy center in Bangalore. Sambhavam works with about 30 to 40 families each year, providing early intervention, parent training and counselling, to help families living with autism manage their lives better.\nWe believe autism to be an expression of neurodiversity in humans. Different, not less - as Temple Grandin puts it. We don’t think autism is a curse, tragedy, suffering or doom. We don’t think people on the autism spectrum need to be ‘cured’ or be made ‘normal’ or that autism should be eradicated.\nWe believe that children and adults on the spectrum should be provided the help they need to make sense of themselves and the world around them. We also believe that the world around them (including their famlies) needs help to be more aware of autism and be able to make sense of people on the spectrum.\nWe see Farm Hill as a necessary continuation of our work at Sambhavam.\n\nWant get involved?\nWrite to us!\nContact Us"

    "text": "What a wonderful book to introduce Ambedkar to children!\n\nHaving learnt about Gandhi till October 2nd, we wished to start learning about Dr. Ambedkar. This is among the books we will be using. Absolutely thrilled!\nHere is a quote from the postface, which is the more serious portion of the book.\n“The world is aware of Mahatma Gandhi’s train journey in South Africa where he was thrown out of a compartment despite possessing a first-class ticket. In comparison, even in India, far fewer people are aware of a similar, hugely significant train journey that Ambedkar undertook with his siblings while he was yet a child. If Gandhi’s famed train episode in South Africa exposed the racial bias of the colonisers, Babasaheb’s journey exposed the terrible evil of caste that has afflicted India for centuries. The colonisers have left but caste continues to afflict us like an incurable virus.\nThe parallels do not end there. Everyone knows of the Mahatma’s famed Dandi March undertaken in 1930 to protest the salt tax imposed by the British, but far fewer know of the peaceful march undertaken by Ambedkar three years prior to Gandhi’s march, in 1927. The long, non-violent march undertaken by thousands of Dalits, now known as the Mahad Satyagraha, was to the Chowdar Lake at Mahad, to protest against the ‘custom’ whereby Dalits were not permitted to use the waters of the lake! The salt tax was unfair and the world came to know about it, but if you stop to think about it, it was immeasurably worse to disallow Dalits from consuming water from a water source available to everyone else. As Dr Ambedkar himself famously said: ’Political tyranny is nothing compared to social tyranny, and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man that a politician who defies government.”\nRAJESH TALWAR\nPage 131"

    "text": "The tiny stream next to farm hill has been flowing this year, for the first time since we came here four years ago. Neighbours say this hadn’t happened in the ten years before as well.\n\nToday, we asked how much water could actually be flowing through the stream. Considering it’s a small stream, the initial estimates varied between 10 to 20 buckets per hour. That’s about 200 to 400 liters per hour.\nIt’s a really small stream and it’s hardly a foot across at the narrow point where it flows out of a small pool we dug last season. That gave us the idea of putting a bucket in the stream, completely stopping it for a few seconds, and measuring the time and the water.\nSo we did it. We noticed that the ideal time to stop the stream is for about five seconds. We caught the water for 4.63 seconds. When we measured the water, it turned out to be 7.5 liters.\nWhat does that mean? 7.5 liters in 4.63 seconds is 1.6 liters per second. That’s good math, but it didn’t mean anything to any of us.\nThen we played around with the numbers, asking how much water per minute? Turns out 60 * 1.6 is about 100 liters. So it’s about 6000 liters per hour.\nAnd that’s about three tanks like the ones we have at farm hill. Usually when we fill all the three tanks, the water lasts for about two days!\nSo an hour of water in the tiny stream is enough for us for two days. And in a day, it pumps out 1,44,000 liters of water, which is close to double the size of the ten foot deep rain water harvesting tank we have. And the water will last us a month and half!\nNeedless to say, the kids were blown away. That’s the power of rain, surface water and small streams."

So close that you can look at a 4cm high newly growing plant anywhere on the farm and be abel to tell whether it is something you planted or not.\n\nThe strength to consistently say no to devices of convenience and live simply, in a house without plumbing.\nSuch level of resource consciousness that you live off the grid and use only rain water you have harvested.\nConstant observation and learning. Learning of the kind that makes you see your own mistakes and learn how to rectify them. Like learning that the trees you intially planted to green the place have started to become invasive and learning how to control them.\n\nExperimentation and patience. Still digging trenches, making bigger pits, growing plants without any need for watering. Looking out for new plants, and new methods.\nThe humility to wear your “achievements” lightly enough to pick up cow dung wherever you see it when on a walk.\nDeep knowledge of plants and soil. You not only know the English, botanical, local names of the plants but you know their properties, how they impact each other, and the soil.\n\nThankfulness and generosity. Still recalling where you got which seeds and cuttings from, and be thankful about it. Willingness to share your knowledge and your resources unstintingly.\nIt does take a lot but doesn’t sound like it is too much to do. To say this experience was inspiring, doesn’t even start to cover it.\n\nFeeling overwhelmingly thankful and happy."

    "title": "Wastewater Management At Farm Hill",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Farm Hill, like any human habitation, generates two varieties of wastewater - gray water and black water. Gray water is produced at sinks, bathrooms and the kitchen, while black water originates from toilets.\nGray Water\nThe main building \nIn the main building, we have four bathrooms, two sinks and a plate washing area. The gray water coming from the bathrooms contains only soap and some dirt, so it does not need a digester. It is instead sent into a chamber where the sludge is allowed to settle to the bottom, while the water flows on into a channel dug into the dirt. \n\nThis channel feeds an entire grove of banana trees. The banana trees produce bananas for us to eat. Small banana saplings grow around each banana tree. When one banana tree is cut down after producing one bunch of bananas, the saplings grow on and become trees in their turn. The banana grove more or less sustains itself. \nHowever, the sludge still has some BOD, so to take care of this, we spray an enzyme composed of lemon zest, jaggery and water. The enzyme breaks down the organic matter, reducing the BOD of the sludge, and it also prevents any possibility of mosquitoes laying their eggs in the water. Another benefit of the enzyme is that it drastically reduces the smell of the sludge. The sludge is regularly removed and dried, and then used on our vegetable beds.\nThe kitchen\nThe kitchen has a sink inside, as well as a washing area outside. The gray water from both of these places goes into a small, open chamber where the sludge settles down, leaving the water on top.\n\nThe chamber leads to another chamber, which performs the same function. Both the chambers are cleaned out fairly regularly. The second chamber opens into a long channel made from bent metal sheets. This channel has holes in the bottom to let water drip out and support plants. \nAt the beginning of the channel, where there is more water, we have a few banana plants. Later on, there are hardier, less thirsty plants, like ivy gourd, Madras thorn, pumpkin, gulmohar etc., and at the end of the channel, where most of the sludge is deposited, there is one banana plant, as well as a few self-supporting vegetable plants like tomatoes.\nThe density of plants at the end of the channel is very high, due to the large amount of sludge. These plants break down the sludge, and they also reduce the stench and effectively do all the work of managing the sludge deposit. This sludge is also collected, dried and used in garden beds.\nThe dorm bathrooms\nThe gray water from the dorm bathrooms and the dorm sinks is taken away from the dorm where people live, through a long pipe. It flows into a large chamber that lets the sludge settle down. \nThe water then overflows and opens into a long trench, watering a row of Gliricidia plants. \nHowever, now the plants have become independent and can survive without human intervention, a new channel for the pipe is being made. Our plan is for the channel to lead to a brand-new garden bed, which will be used for growing roses. So, effectively, the gray water from the dorm bathrooms will one day become a bunch of roses. \nBlack water\nFarm Hill’s sewage system does not carry waste out of campus. Human waste is processed at the site of deposition, using an innovative biological digestion approach. There are three sets of toilets at Farm Hill, designed one after the other. We had quite a journey and lots of things to learn from designing these toilets. Below is the journey that led to these toilets.\nThe dorm toilets\nAt the dorm, the toilet commodes have two separate openings in the bottom, one for urine and one for feces. Each opening leads straight down into a different gunny sack. Each sack contains rice husks, lime, charcoal and a pre-introduced bacterial culture. The idea is that human wastes are broken down by the bacterial cultures. \nHowever, in the first six months, we got complaints of swarms of flies, along with an offensive smell. Another problem was that there was nothing between the users of the toilets and the sacks themselves, so people could see into the pit and that made them uncomfortable. With time, as the biological culture took hold and grew, the smell and flies reduced. \nAnother problem was with the construction requirement. We had to build the toilets raised off the ground on a stone platform, and then make a separate space for the sacks, and then seal off the space. This was a lot of construction effort. Also, the commodes were custom-made, making them costly and difficult to procure. \nThe main building\nWhen we designed the toilets in the main building, we wanted to rectify the mistakes made with the dorm toilets. Therefore, we switched to common, everyday commodes, complete with a full flush and a water seal. The normal commodes were cheaper and easier to source. The water seal took care of the flies and the smell problems. \nHowever, we still wanted to reduce the amount of flushing each day, so we introduced a flap just above the water line in the commode, to cover the poop. Our hope was that this would reduce flushing and leave the poop to decompose on its own, starting in the commode and leading to the digester. \nThe digester chamber for these toilets consists of an inner drum and an outer drum. The waste is ideally processed and filtered in these drums, and clean water flows out through a pipe into a pit that contains some charcoal. \n\nHowever, the flaps did not function well and had to be removed. This led to people flushing more to push the poop out of sight. The increased flushing sent more water to the digester drums than they could handle. \nSoon, the digester drums overflowed, filling the chamber around them with a sludge of poop and water. The commodes started filling up with backed up water. \nWe opened the digester chambers, looked at the sludge and moved it around a little. The outlet water was still clean and clear. Which meant that the digester, and the bacterial culture was working, even when overwhelmed. Our toilet scientist Ravi made some more enzymes that took care of the accumulated sludge. \nThe digester system is currently working well, even with the overdose of water, but we fear that this will not last forever. So, we decided to construct a third set of toilets, drawing on all our experiences with toilets so far.\nThe new dry toilets\nOur third set of toilets consists only of a commode and a water faucet with a handgun. The commode sits on top of a pit, which is filled with the digester materials to a depth of about three feet. At the bottom of the commode is the key component - a gravity tipped flap. The flap stops some water above it, and whenever the weight increases a little, it tips over, sending the waste into the pit below. The digester digests the waste and clean water seeps underground. \n\nWe have been using these toilets for about two month. These toilets are easy to clean, there is no smell, no flies, are pleasing to the eye, and use only a very small amount of water to function. \nThe commodes in these toilets and the flaps are imported and are a little bit pricey. While it would be nice if we can reduce the cost, it might not be a large price to pay for the eco friendliness and the ease of use of these toilets."
