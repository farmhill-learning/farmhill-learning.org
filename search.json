Do you agree that we need to fundamentally rethink our approach to ourselves, our relationships with others, nature, food systems, health and the need to rebuild a more sustainable education ecosystem?\nAre you willing to join hands with a group of committed, capable people woarking with these objectives?\nYou can become a Friend of Farmhill - this a group of people who believe the work we do at Farmhill is important and support us financially and otherwise. Many friends visit us periodically, participate in the events we conduct, and stay with us once in a while!\nHere is how you can support us."

However, this is not always possible due to a few reasons.\n\nWe are a small community and we have not yet reached the optimum size where we can fully meet the operations costs.\nWe believe that people interested in joining the community should be able to join irrespective of their ability to contribute financially, which means we often end up with a deficit budget.\nFarm Hill Education Trust has committed to build Subodha Learning Community, located in Bangalore, to better reach underserved populations.\nThe community is still very young. We are still incurring capital expenses for infrastructure, which cannot be met except for contributions from the larger community of friends and supporters.\n\nMost importantly, you get to be a part of a community working for a cause!"

    "title": "Wastewater Management At Farm Hill",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Farm Hill, like any human habitation, generates two varieties of wastewater - gray water and black water. Gray water is produced at sinks, bathrooms and the kitchen, while black water originates from toilets.\nGray Water\nThe main building \nIn the main building, we have four bathrooms, two sinks and a plate washing area. The gray water coming from the bathrooms contains only soap and some dirt, so it does not need a digester. It is instead sent into a chamber where the sludge is allowed to settle to the bottom, while the water flows on into a channel dug into the dirt. \n\nThis channel feeds an entire grove of banana trees. The banana trees produce bananas for us to eat. Small banana saplings grow around each banana tree. When one banana tree is cut down after producing one bunch of bananas, the saplings grow on and become trees in their turn. The banana grove more or less sustains itself. \nHowever, the sludge still has some BOD, so to take care of this, we spray an enzyme composed of lemon zest, jaggery and water. The enzyme breaks down the organic matter, reducing the BOD of the sludge, and it also prevents any possibility of mosquitoes laying their eggs in the water. Another benefit of the enzyme is that it drastically reduces the smell of the sludge. The sludge is regularly removed and dried, and then used on our vegetable beds.\nThe kitchen\nThe kitchen has a sink inside, as well as a washing area outside. The gray water from both of these places goes into a small, open chamber where the sludge settles down, leaving the water on top.\n\nThe chamber leads to another chamber, which performs the same function. Both the chambers are cleaned out fairly regularly. The second chamber opens into a long channel made from bent metal sheets. This channel has holes in the bottom to let water drip out and support plants. \nAt the beginning of the channel, where there is more water, we have a few banana plants. Later on, there are hardier, less thirsty plants, like ivy gourd, Madras thorn, pumpkin, gulmohar etc., and at the end of the channel, where most of the sludge is deposited, there is one banana plant, as well as a few self-supporting vegetable plants like tomatoes.\nThe density of plants at the end of the channel is very high, due to the large amount of sludge. These plants break down the sludge, and they also reduce the stench and effectively do all the work of managing the sludge deposit. This sludge is also collected, dried and used in garden beds.\nThe dorm bathrooms\nThe gray water from the dorm bathrooms and the dorm sinks is taken away from the dorm where people live, through a long pipe. It flows into a large chamber that lets the sludge settle down. \nThe water then overflows and opens into a long trench, watering a row of Gliricidia plants. \nHowever, now the plants have become independent and can survive without human intervention, a new channel for the pipe is being made. Our plan is for the channel to lead to a brand-new garden bed, which will be used for growing roses. So, effectively, the gray water from the dorm bathrooms will one day become a bunch of roses. \nBlack water\nFarm Hill’s sewage system does not carry waste out of campus. Human waste is processed at the site of deposition, using an innovative biological digestion approach. There are three sets of toilets at Farm Hill, designed one after the other. We had quite a journey and lots of things to learn from designing these toilets. Below is the journey that led to these toilets.\nThe dorm toilets\nAt the dorm, the toilet commodes have two separate openings in the bottom, one for urine and one for feces. Each opening leads straight down into a different gunny sack. Each sack contains rice husks, lime, charcoal and a pre-introduced bacterial culture. The idea is that human wastes are broken down by the bacterial cultures. \nHowever, in the first six months, we got complaints of swarms of flies, along with an offensive smell. Another problem was that there was nothing between the users of the toilets and the sacks themselves, so people could see into the pit and that made them uncomfortable. With time, as the biological culture took hold and grew, the smell and flies reduced. \nAnother problem was with the construction requirement. We had to build the toilets raised off the ground on a stone platform, and then make a separate space for the sacks, and then seal off the space. This was a lot of construction effort. Also, the commodes were custom-made, making them costly and difficult to procure. \nThe main building\nWhen we designed the toilets in the main building, we wanted to rectify the mistakes made with the dorm toilets. Therefore, we switched to common, everyday commodes, complete with a full flush and a water seal. The normal commodes were cheaper and easier to source. The water seal took care of the flies and the smell problems. \nHowever, we still wanted to reduce the amount of flushing each day, so we introduced a flap just above the water line in the commode, to cover the poop. Our hope was that this would reduce flushing and leave the poop to decompose on its own, starting in the commode and leading to the digester. \nThe digester chamber for these toilets consists of an inner drum and an outer drum. The waste is ideally processed and filtered in these drums, and clean water flows out through a pipe into a pit that contains some charcoal. \n\nHowever, the flaps did not function well and had to be removed. This led to people flushing more to push the poop out of sight. The increased flushing sent more water to the digester drums than they could handle. \nSoon, the digester drums overflowed, filling the chamber around them with a sludge of poop and water. The commodes started filling up with backed up water. \nWe opened the digester chambers, looked at the sludge and moved it around a little. The outlet water was still clean and clear. Which meant that the digester, and the bacterial culture was working, even when overwhelmed. Our toilet scientist Ravi made some more enzymes that took care of the accumulated sludge. \nThe digester system is currently working well, even with the overdose of water, but we fear that this will not last forever. So, we decided to construct a third set of toilets, drawing on all our experiences with toilets so far.\nThe new dry toilets\nOur third set of toilets consists only of a commode and a water faucet with a handgun. The commode sits on top of a pit, which is filled with the digester materials to a depth of about three feet. At the bottom of the commode is the key component - a gravity tipped flap. The flap stops some water above it, and whenever the weight increases a little, it tips over, sending the waste into the pit below. The digester digests the waste and clean water seeps underground. \n\nWe have been using these toilets for about two month. These toilets are easy to clean, there is no smell, no flies, are pleasing to the eye, and use only a very small amount of water to function. \nThe commodes in these toilets and the flaps are imported and are a little bit pricey. While it would be nice if we can reduce the cost, it might not be a large price to pay for the eco friendliness and the ease of use of these toilets."

For better context, 500mm is the cut off for ‘areas of very little rainfall’ in India.\n\nDo the pictures look like it? What has it taken to do something like this?\n\n15 years of living close to the soil. So close that you are intimate. So close that you can look at a 4cm high newly growing plant anywhere on the farm and be abel to tell whether it is something you planted or not.\n\nThe strength to consistently say no to devices of convenience and live simply, in a house without plumbing.\nSuch level of resource consciousness that you live off the grid and use only rain water you have harvested.\nConstant observation and learning. Learning of the kind that makes you see your own mistakes and learn how to rectify them. Like learning that the trees you intially planted to green the place have started to become invasive and learning how to control them.\n\nExperimentation and patience. Still digging trenches, making bigger pits, growing plants without any need for watering. Looking out for new plants, and new methods.\nThe humility to wear your “achievements” lightly enough to pick up cow dung wherever you see it when on a walk.\nDeep knowledge of plants and soil. You not only know the English, botanical, local names of the plants but you know their properties, how they impact each other, and the soil.\n\nThankfulness and generosity. Still recalling where you got which seeds and cuttings from, and be thankful about it. Willingness to share your knowledge and your resources unstintingly.\nIt does take a lot but doesn’t sound like it is too much to do. To say this experience was inspiring, doesn’t even start to cover it.\n\nFeeling overwhelmingly thankful and happy."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The tiny stream next to farm hill has been flowing this year, for the first time since we came here four years ago. Neighbours say this hadn’t happened in the ten years before as well.\n\nToday, we asked how much water could actually be flowing through the stream. Considering it’s a small stream, the initial estimates varied between 10 to 20 buckets per hour. That’s about 200 to 400 liters per hour.\nIt’s a really small stream and it’s hardly a foot across at the narrow point where it flows out of a small pool we dug last season. That gave us the idea of putting a bucket in the stream, completely stopping it for a few seconds, and measuring the time and the water.\nSo we did it. We noticed that the ideal time to stop the stream is for about five seconds. We caught the water for 4.63 seconds. When we measured the water, it turned out to be 7.5 liters.\nWhat does that mean? 7.5 liters in 4.63 seconds is 1.6 liters per second. That’s good math, but it didn’t mean anything to any of us.\nThen we played around with the numbers, asking how much water per minute? Turns out 60 * 1.6 is about 100 liters. So it’s about 6000 liters per hour.\nAnd that’s about three tanks like the ones we have at farm hill. Usually when we fill all the three tanks, the water lasts for about two days!\nSo an hour of water in the tiny stream is enough for us for two days. And in a day, it pumps out 1,44,000 liters of water, which is close to double the size of the ten foot deep rain water harvesting tank we have. And the water will last us a month and half!\nNeedless to say, the kids were blown away. That’s the power of rain, surface water and small streams."

We could have let the fire burn the hill and still stayed safe but we didn’t want to. With timely use of resources, we held our fire lines.\n\nWe will be better prepared the next time. We will create more resources for this kind of thing for the next season. It’s just a matter of routine now.\nIt was commendable how the children stood their ground, helped carry water, stayed safe and pretty much self organised as the adults were all busy with the fire. They demonstrated great faith in themselves and us.\n\nNow I can say is there is much hope for the future of this community, going by this experience of how the adults and, more importantly, the children responded to the situation. And that’s the important bit we wanted to share with all of you.\nThanks!"

    "text": "It was like any other day. I was looking forward to a free day as many children were in a craft workshop and only a few were at farmhill.\nThen I saw that Akhil did not have anything planned and he was getting bored, so were the little ones in Shishu. Akhil is a 17 year old autistic young man and the two girls in Shishu are six and three and half.\nYou may think, ‘what can they do together?’, but at farmhill, we do not differentiate with age, gender or in any other way. Everyone calls everyone by name most of the time and that is respectful. Age is actually only a number.\nAkhil is extremely skilled with his hands, an artist and a cook by heart. However, he finds it hard to engage with language concepts. We are working with language so that he can share his thoughts and feelings, and eventually, regulate his emotions better. The minute he sees print or hears a question, Akhil ignores us, as he finds it difficult to respond. Even if he makes eye contact, he immediately says ‘I don’t know’ and moves away.\nThe two girls are very communicative and curious but they do get bored easily.\nI decided I would try an activity with them together.\nI chose ‘Compare and contrast’ as a concept.\nWe started with identifying the same and different among similar looking leaves and flowers. They even pointed out that one flower that I drew was different because it had a bigger circle at the center than the rest.\nThen I moved on to comparing ‘Cat’ and an ‘Elephant’.\nI drew both the pictures on the board and asked what is ‘same’ in both. They all took turns identifying similar features. Akhil was distracted initially, but came back to the conversation and participated.\nKivi tried to draw and write while Anana drew. Akhil wrote in his notebook.\nThen we moved on to identify what’s different between a cat and an elephant. Kivi was ready with her point and Akhil chimed in pointing to the trunk. Anana said that the elephant has big ears. When I asked Akhil to look at the size, he was able to identify one as a bigger animal.\nHere are Kivi’s notes:\n\nThen I asked them to compare ‘Kivi’ and ‘Anana’. They had so much fun! When I said ‘Anana is a’, Akhil filled in ‘girl’. So we wrote that down as “same”. Anana pointed out that both of them wear ‘coconut tree’ style hair on their head :). See the picture.\nWe discussed what is different. Kivi said she is wearing a t-shirt while Anana is wearing a frock. Akhil said that Kivi is wearing pants and Anana is …(Anana supplied ‘skirt’). And so on.\n\nKivi got inspired and drew two birds for me. She asked me to find out what is different. See the beautiful pictures she drew and her phonetic spelling for ‘Different’. She was so happy when I solved her worksheet.\n\nNow Anana had to test me. So, she also drew two flowers and asked me to tell what is same and different. Look at the picture. I found out the answer and then they went off to play. I was amazed at how engaged they were throughout.\n\nAkhil and I continued our discussion. He compared two coffee cups and he noticed that their designs are different. He found it easy when I gave the labels ‘cup 1’ and ‘cup 2’.\n\nThen we compared pictures of two trees. He identified that one had lesser fruits than the other.\n\nThen we finally compared ‘Akhil’ and his brother ‘Abhi’ What is the same? He identified both of them as boys as a fill in to ‘Akhil is a …’ Then I asked who Akhil’s parents were. He said ‘Mommy and nanna’. When I asked the same question about Abhi, he looked at me questioningly. I kept quiet. It felt like he was asking, ‘Really? Do we really share the parents?’ :). He finally relented after a minute and said ‘Mommy and Nanna’. For the third point about glasses, I showed a photograph and asked what is the same, but he kept repeating the question. Then I drew line drawings on the board, and he saw I was drawing the glasses. He did not comment. Then I asked, ‘What are you wearing?’. He said ’I am wearing glasses, Abhi is wearing glasses.\nWhat is different? I asked ‘How old are you? He wrote but he did not know about Abhi. I sent him to his mother to ask. He had to frame a question for the same. Then I showed the picture to ask what else he sees as different. Only when I said look at their size, he said that Akhil is tall. For the third point, we had a little bit of discussion about age words ‘elder’ and ‘younger’."

    "text": "At Farm Hill, we are at the bottom slope of a group of hills. At the lowest point, just next to the place, we have a water channel.\nWe have a few mango trees at Farm Hill. When I asked the previous owners where they got water from to plant the trees, they said they used to dig a shallow well next to the water channel and get water. When I asked if it’s still possible to do so, they said no, since there haven’t been good rains of late. This was a year back when we were just buying the place and I had forgotten about it.\nThe summer of 2019 was bad. It’s been about 10 years since the last major rains and all borewells went dry in May. In a 2 week period in May, about 15 bore wells around us were either deepened or freshly dug. The average depth of water level went down to more than 750 feet from about 450 feet. Our 500 feet borewell went fully dry. The rains this season have been good but it hasn’t recovered yet.\nMeanwhile, since getting the place, we looked at the slopes, dug about 5 levels of trenches, a few water holding ponds and more or less stopped rain water from flowing out of the space.\n\nA couple of days back, a member of our construction team noticed a little bit of water in a small hole in the water channel. When we checked, it turns out that was the place they used to get water in a shallow well earlier. Ganesan L went ahead and got a small shallow well, about 3 feet deep, dug.\n\nRight now we have water in it. We will watch it for a few days and see if we can deepen it further. This feels awesome being able to tap the shallow aquifer.\nAnd it made a great science lesson too!"

One day, he was all charred, someone had lit a fire to burn weeds and he was caught in the middle.\nAfter about a couple of years, happy to see today that he is back in bloom.\nAnd this season, not many Palash are blooming. Last year by this time, every tree around broke out in bloom. Don’t know what that means in terms of climate and impact, but our belief that trees are much more than what we think of them just gets strengthened a little more when we see such demonstrations of what one could call “willfulness”. 🙂🙂\nThese pictures are from today.\n\nA long shot but you can still see the flowers."

    "text": "Let’s begin with a confession: we rarely call ourselves a “school.” The word feels too tight, too loaded with assumptions about time, authority, and what it means to learn. Instead, at Farm Hill, we speak of a learning community-a space where children, adults, teachers and parents are invited to learn together. This is not just semantics. It’s a deliberate stance, born from years of working in both mainstream and alternative schools, and from the deep conviction that the system itself needs questioning, not just tweaking."

    "section": "System: Questioning the Frame",
    "text": "System: Questioning the Frame\nMost schools, whether state board or CBSE, operate within a rigid frame: fixed schedules, age-based grades, teachers as knowledge-holders, students as recipients. This frame persists even in well-intentioned “innovative” schools, where the curriculum may be more flexible but the underlying assumptions remain untouched. We’ve seen this up close-children with and without disabilities, all squeezed into a system that often ignores their needs, their rhythms, and their right to explore.\nAt Farm Hill, we started with a different question: What if we built from scratch, not just a new curriculum, but a new relationship to learning itself? What if we acknowledged that our own imaginations are limited by the systems we’ve inherited? For example, many of us-parents and teachers alike-believe that children need to be taught everything, from eating to sleeping, by experts. This belief is so deep that it shapes our very definition of education. But is it true? Is school the only way to learn?\nWe found that even when we experienced curricular or philosophical freedom, there were other freedoms-freedom from structure, freedom from the compulsion to teach-that we hadn’t dared to try. The idea of not having a weekly Hindi period, for instance, can be deeply unsettling to a teacher who has never seen learning happen outside that frame. Our challenge, then, is not just to innovate within the system, but to question the system itself."

    "text": "Pedagogy: Innovation and Its Limits\nPedagogical innovation is often the most visible face of “rethinking school.” Activity-based learning, project work, value education, environmental sensitization-these are all important, and we do them. But we are also aware that pedagogy is always shaped by the system around it. Freedom is never absolute; it is always negotiated.\nFor instance, with a small number of students, we can be flexible-if a child needs an extra year, we can allow it. We can ramp up or down according to the child’s needs, not the demands of a fixed calendar. But as the scale increases, as the need to train more teachers and accommodate more children grows, structure becomes inevitable. The very innovations we cherish must be embedded within a framework that can be explained, replicated, and sustained. This is not a failure; it’s a reality. The question is not whether to have structure, but how to design it so that it supports, rather than stifles, genuine learning."

    "text": "Support: Community, Technology, and the Teacher’s Journey\nSupport is often thought of as something given to students, but in our experience, it is equally about supporting teachers and parents as they unlearn old habits and assumptions. Most of our teachers are navigating the curriculum for the first time, especially in higher grades. They need hand-holding, not just in content, but in reimagining their roles.\nTechnology, too, is becoming a companion. Tools that record and analyze classroom interactions can provide mirrors for teachers, helping them see patterns and biases they might otherwise miss. But these are just tools. The real work is in building a culture where questioning-of oneself, of the system, of what counts as success-is not just allowed, but encouraged.\nWe are also mindful of our constraints: space, resources, the willingness of parents to walk a slower, less certain path. No school or philosophy can cater to everyone. We focus on those ready to join us in this experiment, knowing that even here, independence is always relative, always negotiated."

When we say ‘every child is different’, many of us do not seem to be extending the definition of ‘different’ to include children whose neurologies are different. Farm Hill intends to address this by including children on the autism spectrum in our student population.\nOver a period of time, we have found that the way one educates an autistic child is no different from the way one educates a neurotypical child; it is just that the current school system is suitable for neither. We intend to work with both neurotypical and autistic children in a setting that takes care of the unique needs of each child."

Different, not less - as Temple Grandin puts it. We don’t think autism is a curse, tragedy, suffering or doom. We don’t think people on the autism spectrum need to be ‘cured’ or be made ‘normal’ or that autism should be eradicated.\nWe believe that children and adults on the spectrum should be provided the help they need to make sense of themselves and the world around them. We also believe that the world around them (including their famlies) needs help to be more aware of autism and be able to make sense of people on the spectrum.\nWe see Farm Hill as a necessary continuation of our work at Sambhavam.\n\nWant get involved?\nWrite to us!\nContact Us"

    "text": "What a wonderful book to introduce Ambedkar to children!\n\nHaving learnt about Gandhi till October 2nd, we wished to start learning about Dr. Ambedkar. This is among the books we will be using. Absolutely thrilled!\nHere is a quote from the postface, which is the more serious portion of the book.\n“The world is aware of Mahatma Gandhi’s train journey in South Africa where he was thrown out of a compartment despite possessing a first-class ticket. In comparison, even in India, far fewer people are aware of a similar, hugely significant train journey that Ambedkar undertook with his siblings while he was yet a child. If Gandhi’s famed train episode in South Africa exposed the racial bias of the colonisers, Babasaheb’s journey exposed the terrible evil of caste that has afflicted India for centuries. The colonisers have left but caste continues to afflict us like an incurable virus.\nThe parallels do not end there. Everyone knows of the Mahatma’s famed Dandi March undertaken in 1930 to protest the salt tax imposed by the British, but far fewer know of the peaceful march undertaken by Ambedkar three years prior to Gandhi’s march, in 1927. The long, non-violent march undertaken by thousands of Dalits, now known as the Mahad Satyagraha, was to the Chowdar Lake at Mahad, to protest against the ‘custom’ whereby Dalits were not permitted to use the waters of the lake! The salt tax was unfair and the world came to know about it, but if you stop to think about it, it was immeasurably worse to disallow Dalits from consuming water from a water source available to everyone else. As Dr Ambedkar himself famously said: ’Political tyranny is nothing compared to social tyranny, and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man that a politician who defies government.”\nRAJESH TALWAR\nPage 131"

Then we took a path down the hill, to join one of the paths that would take us back to farm hill.\nOnce we hit the familiar path, we took right instead of left. A little along the path, a left instead of the usual right, on to a cart track.

There does seem to be more water in 2019, and the water is brown, indicating soil runoff. Today, there is less water, and the water does not have that much soil runoff.\nWhile one may not be able to say much about the quantity of water with any level of certainty based just on this, one hypothesis is that due to the growth of grass and plants in the intervening period across the property, there may be more local absorption of rain, less soil runoff and therefore less muddy water in the trenches.\nThis is kind of born out by the fact that we have water standing pretty much everywhere and a very small spring or two appearing at the base of the hill.\nThat’s a good thing, isn’t it? 🙂\nDo notice the Veppala tree on the left bank of the pond, and how it’s grown all by itself!"

This may take a couple of weeks.\n\n7. These keep for a year, apparently. Just crush a small amount and add to seasoning when making dal.\n\nSince these balls are made using onions, garlic, castor oil etc non-satvik food, they attract bad spirits called peyi/pisasi in Tamil.

    "text": "At farm hill, we are in a rain shadow region where the average rain fall is closer to 800mm. There are no major surface water sources like rivers nearby; and the one there is, comes from Bangalore, full of waste water.\nNaturally, most of the agriculture here depends on ground water. Vegetables and green leaves are grown, but it is not uncommon to see water guzzling crops like rice too. Suffice it to say that the average depth of a borewell in this region has gone up by about 200 feet in the last three years.\nIn such scenario, our long term water management strategy needed to include surface water harvesting and some way of tapping the shallow aquifer, in addition to a borewell.\nConsidering the roof size and the rainfall, we could potentially harvest 250,000 liters of water annually, which is about a third of our current water requirement. Taking various factors into consideration, we invested in building an underground water harvesting tank of about 85,000 liters.\nThe last ten days of cyclonic weather meant the tank is nearly full. Right now, we estimate about 75,000 liters in the tank. That’s a happy thing.\nOn the other hand, these rains have been unseasonal, and heavy, causing a lot of damage to crops and devastation. Also, even here in the rain shadow region, about 30% of the entire annual rainfall happened in a single week, after a prolonged near dry spell during the monsoon, and that’s not great.\nIt’s a mixed feeling, I guess."

    "title": "Project - Building a Kennel 2024-25",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Constructing a kennel is often seen as a straightforward task - an exercise in providing shelter for animals. However, when approached as a collaborative, educational project, it transforms into a rich experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and sustainable building practices. This article details the process of building an 8x4 feet kennel, emphasizing the methods, materials, and learnings that emerged from the collective effort of children and adults. The project not only resulted in a functional structure for five dogs but also served as a practical classroom for hands-on learning and traditional construction techniques.\n\nPlanning and Plot Selection\nThe project commenced with the selection of a suitable plot of land. The size of the kennel was determined to be 8 feet by 4 feet, a dimension that balanced available space with the needs of the animals. The process of marking out this rectangle on the ground became the first significant learning opportunity. Using a measuring tape, the children attempted to draw the rectangle. However, their initial efforts resulted in a parallelogram rather than a true rectangle.\nThis challenge introduced the concept of geometric accuracy in construction. The children experimented with moving the sides of the shape to correct it, but the solution eluded them until an adult facilitator, Ganesan, explained a fundamental principle: for a rectangle, the diagonals must be of equal length. Demonstrating with sticks, Ganesan illustrated that by measuring and adjusting the diagonals, one could ensure the shape was a perfect rectangle. This practical lesson in geometry not only corrected the layout but also reinforced mathematical concepts in a tangible context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing the foundation\nWith the rectangle properly marked, attention shifted to preparing the foundation. The foundation is a critical element in any structure, providing stability and longevity. For this kennel, the plan specified that the foundation should be double the width of the wall to ensure adequate support and durability. To achieve this, the foundation trench was marked so that the extra width was distributed equally on both sides of the wall—half the additional width inside and half outside the marked boundary of the wall. This careful distribution ensured that the wall would be centered on the foundation and well-supported against soil movement and moisture.\nThe task of digging the foundation was largely undertaken by the children, with occasional assistance from adults. This high level of participation fostered a sense of ownership and responsibility. Stones collected from around the campus were used to fill the trench, and this stone layer was then combined with a mixture of mud and water to create a firm base. The process of gathering materials, mixing, and filling the foundation provided practical lessons in resource management and teamwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Construction: Materials and Methods\nOnce the foundation was set, the construction of the walls began. The first layer was built using bricks, but a decision was made to construct the remaining walls without bricks, opting instead for a traditional mixture of mud, grass, and water. This method, often referred to as cob or adobe construction, is both sustainable and cost-effective. Stones were intermittently embedded within the mud walls to enhance structural integrity.\nThe walls were constructed gradually, with only one layer added each day. Each layer was allowed to dry completely before the next was applied, a process that spanned several weeks and ultimately resulted in walls three feet high. This slow, methodical approach ensured the stability of the structure and minimized the risk of cracks or collapse.\nThe interior of the kennel was divided into two rooms by a middle wall. This dividing wall was constructed using a bamboo framework, which was then packed with mud. The use of bamboo not only provided structural support but also introduced the children to alternative building materials and techniques. During this phase, the children learned to tie basic knots, a skill essential for securing bamboo in construction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring Accuracy: Traditional Tools\nMaintaining level and straight walls is crucial in any building project. To facilitate this, Ganesh Anna, an experienced builder, created two simple, kid-friendly tools: an A-frame and a plumb bob. The A-frame, a triangular wooden frame with a string and weight, was used to check the level of the walls. The plumb bob, a pointed weight suspended from a string, helped ensure that the walls were vertically straight.\nThese tools were specifically designed by Ganesan to be easy for children to use. The children quickly learned to apply them, gaining practical experience in maintaining construction accuracy. This exposure to traditional tools reinforced the importance of precision in building and provided a direct link to time-tested construction practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather Protection and Plastering\nEarthen walls, while sustainable and aesthetically pleasing, are vulnerable to rain and moisture. To address this, the roof was designed to extend beyond the walls, providing additional protection from direct rainfall. Furthermore, the walls were coated with a plastering mixture that included a small amount of cement and lime. The lime served as a natural water repellent, enhancing the durability of the mud walls.\nPlastering was another hands-on activity in which the children participated. They learned to mix the plaster and apply it evenly, gaining insight into finishing techniques that are essential for weatherproofing and aesthetics.\n\n\nCreative Elements: Mosaics and Light\nA distinctive feature of the kennel was the addition of mosaic designs on the walls. Waste tiles, collected from a local shop, were broken into smaller pieces and used to create colorful patterns. The initial method involved pressing the tiles directly into the fresh plaster, but this proved inefficient as the plaster dried too quickly. The team then developed a more effective technique: the tiles were glued onto pieces of old mosquito nets, which were then attached to the wall. This approach allowed for more intricate designs and easier application.\nFor natural lighting, glass bottles were embedded into the walls. These bottles, placed strategically, allowed sunlight to filter into the kennel, creating a pleasant and visually appealing environment for the animals. This method of incorporating recycled materials not only enhanced the functionality of the kennel but also demonstrated creative reuse of waste products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoofing and Flooring: Math in Action\nThe roof structure was built using leftover wood and reclaimed roof tiles, reflecting the project’s commitment to sustainability and resourcefulness. A significant part of this phase involved the children applying their classroom mathematics to real-world construction. Before laying the tiles, the children measured the length and width of the roof area, calculated the total area to be covered, and then determined how many tiles would be required. This process involved dividing the total area of the roof by the area of a single tile, a method commonly used in construction to ensure accurate estimates and minimize waste. Older children assisted with cutting and nailing the wood, while younger children contributed to other aspects of the construction.\nThe same method was applied to the flooring. The children measured the length and width of the kennel floor to calculate the total floor area. They then measured the dimensions of a single terracotta tile and divided the total floor area by the area of one tile to find out how many tiles would be needed for the entire floor. This exercise reinforced their understanding of area calculation and estimation, and they also learned to account for a small percentage of extra tiles to cover potential breakage or cutting losses, as is standard in tiling projects. The children then helped lay the tiles, learning about alignment and spacing in the process.\nBy directly engaging in these calculations and measurements, the children connected mathematical concepts with tangible outcomes, deepening their appreciation for the practical applications of their studies. This approach not only ensured efficient use of materials but also provided a meaningful, hands-on learning experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Outcomes and Participation\nOne of the most significant aspects of the kennel project was the high level of child participation. The children were involved in nearly every stage, from digging the foundation and carrying stones to mixing mud, measuring, plastering, and decorating. They used trolleys to transport materials and enjoyed the tactile experience of stepping into the mud. These activities not only made the project enjoyable but also provided valuable lessons in cooperation, problem-solving, and perseverance.\nThe use of traditional tools like the A-frame and plumb bob, as well as the introduction of knot-tying for bamboo construction, enriched the learning experience. The children gained practical skills that are rarely taught in conventional classrooms but are essential for understanding the basics of construction and engineering.\n\n\nProject Completion and Impact\nUpon completion, the kennel provided a comfortable and attractive home for five dogs. The structure stood as a testament to what can be achieved through collective effort, sustainable practices, and experiential learning. The children expressed satisfaction and pride in their work, having contributed meaningfully to every aspect of the build. The adults involved also found the process rewarding, noting the positive impact on the children’s confidence and skills.\nThe project demonstrated that building with natural and recycled materials is not only feasible but also beneficial for both the environment and the community. It highlighted the value of integrating practical skills and academic concepts, such as geometry and arithmetic, into real-world applications.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe kennel building project exemplifies how construction can be transformed into a collaborative, educational, and sustainable endeavor. By involving children in every step—from planning and measuring to building and decorating—the project fostered a sense of ownership, responsibility, and accomplishment. The use of traditional techniques and tools, combined with creative problem-solving and resourcefulness, resulted in a functional and aesthetically pleasing structure.\nThis experience underscores the importance of hands-on learning and community involvement in building projects. It serves as a model for how similar initiatives can be designed to maximize educational value while promoting sustainability and teamwork. The completed kennel is more than just a shelter for animals; it is a lasting symbol of what can be achieved when knowledge, creativity, and cooperation come together in pursuit of a common goal."
