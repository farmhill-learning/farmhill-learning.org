description: Children in Kishkindha (8-12 years) class at Farm Hill built a model of Parijta building to scale in their math class. It took them about 10 classes and a lot of thinking and doing!

Building with cardboard is much more than a craft project - it's a demonstration of how mathematics, design thinking, and community spirit come together in our way of learning. At Farm Hill, learning with the hands and mind is a conversation with the world. This project captures the heart of our approach, combining our constructivist approach to education and the simple joys of genuine discovery and creation.

## Building Parijata: More Than Just a Model

The process children followed - in sketching, planning, measuring, and constructing Parijata from cardboard - translates abstract mathematical ideas into lived, physical experience. A ruler in the hand becomes a tool not just for drawing lines, but for imagining proportions, calculating area, and thinking through relationships between shapes and spaces. These children are quietly, joyfully doing geometry: converting meters to centimeters, visualizing 3D forms from blueprints, and reasoning about symmetry and scale. A question like “Will this wall stand?” opens a window into physics, material science, and collaborative problem solving.

## Learning in Action: The Farm Hill Philosophy

At Farm Hill, learning emerges from real questions, not just from the syllabus and textbooks. The act of building - whether it’s a vegetable bed in the garden or a cardboard model of a building - connects math and science to the pulse of everyday life. Mistakes are not failures, but invitations to explore “What went wrong?” Each child brings ideas, tries out a role, and finds space to ask, “What happens if I do it this way?” This project threads together individual strengths, fostering collaboration, persistence, and reflective thinking, all at the child’s own pace.

## Modeling as Mathematical Storytelling

Mathematical modeling is about more than numbers—it is about making sense of the world. In turning Parijata’s architecture into a model, the children are telling the story of a building, one measurement at a time. They are making decisions about which details matter, which measurements are crucial, and how to simplify complexity without losing meaning. This nurtures mathematical communication, spatial reasoning, and the all-important belief that “I can make sense of the world with mathematics”.

## The Voice of Farm Hill: Learning with Geethika

If one were to wander past the classroom and into the garden, one might hear Geethika asking, “How can we build these steps?”, or reminding a child gently, “Try measuring that again - let’s see if you get the same number.” There is laughter, a bit of friendly arguing about which piece should go where, and much hands-on, hearts-in learning. Here, understanding grows quietly, like a seed in the soil, among friends, cardboard, stories, and sunlight.

At Farm Hill, a cardboard model is not just about the cardboard or the building. It is math you can touch, teamwork you can feel, and a memory of learning that is truly alive.
